        <p class="govuk-body">These SFI agreement terms and conditions set out the rules that you and the RPA must follow for the duration of your agreement. They apply to SFI agreements for the re-opened SFI 2024 offer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="introduction">1. Introduction&nbsp;</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">1.1  The Sustainable Farming Incentive&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">The Sustainable Farming Incentive (“SFI”) is a scheme run by the Rural Payments Agency (referred to below as “us”, “we, “our”) on behalf of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (“Defra”). It is part of the Environmental Land Management Scheme under section 1 of the Agriculture Act 2020 and in conjunction with the Agriculture (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2021 (“the Regulations”).&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">1.2  About these Terms and Conditions&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(a) The SFI agreement (the “Agreement”) comprises:&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the “Agreement Document”, which describes the land parcels in the Agreement (the “Agreement Land”) and the sum to be paid to you (the “Grant”) for delivering the action(s) you have selected (the “Actions”) and which will also include a sum to be paid to you for entering and managing your Agreement (the “SFI Management Payment”);&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) these “Terms and Conditions”, which are applicable to the payment of the Grant; and&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the Actions&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the Grant includes the sum to be paid to you for entering and managing your Agreement (the “SFI Management Payment”). All references to the Grant in these Terms and Conditions include the SFI Management Payment. Details regarding payment of the SFI Management Payment are set out in these Terms and Conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(c) If there is any conflict between these Terms and Conditions, the Agreement Document and the Actions, these Terms and Conditions will be given priority.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(d) When the agreement holder (“you”) enters the Agreement, you are agreeing to the terms applicable to the payment of the Grant.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">1.3 Why you should read the Terms and Conditions&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">You should read the Terms and Conditions carefully because they provide information including:&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(a) how we will pay the Grant to you, as set out in your Agreement Document;&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(b) how you or we may change or end the Agreement; and&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(c) what you need to do if you cannot comply with your obligations under the Agreement.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">1.4 References in the Terms and Conditions</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(b) A reference to the “Law” means any law, statute, subordinate legislation within the meaning of Section 21(1) of the Interpretation Act 1978, byelaw, right within the meaning of Section 4(1) EU Withdrawal Act 2018 as amended by EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020, regulation, order, regulatory policy, statutory guidance which has the effect of law, judgement of a relevant court of law, or directives or requirements of any regulatory body with which you are required to comply.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(c) A reference to a statute or statutory provision is a reference to it as amended, extended or re-enacted from time to time and shall include all subordinate legislation made under that statute or statutory provision.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(d) A reference to a public organisation includes a reference to any successor to that public organisation.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(e) Any words following the terms ‘including’, ‘include’, ‘in particular’ or ‘for example’ or any similar phrase shall be construed as illustrative and shall not limit the generality of the related general words.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(f) Unless the context otherwise requires, words in the singular shall include the plural and in the plural shall include the singular.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">1.5  The SFI Scheme Information&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(a) We have published information relating to SFI on GOV.UK (the “<a href="/government/publications/sustainable-farming-incentive-scheme-expanded-offer-for-2024/sfi-scheme-information-expanded-offer-for-2024">Scheme Information</a>”).

        <p class="govuk-body">(b) We may produce new versions of or amend the Scheme Information throughout the lifetime of SFI. However, the version applicable to you shall be the version which was current when the Agreement commences (the “Agreement Start Date’), unless amended in accordance with condition 6 (Changes to your Agreement).</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">2.4 Agreement Period&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(a) The Agreement is for a period (the “Agreement Period”) from the Agreement Start Date until the latest Action End Date unless terminated earlier under condition 15 (Termination of an Agreement) . The Agreement Start Date and the Agreement End Date are shown in your Agreement Document.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(b) Where the Agreement Document specifies Actions of varying lengths, the terms of the Agreement shall apply in respect of the relevant Action from the date the Action starts (the “Action Start Date”) until the date the Action ends (the “Action End Date”). The Action will expire after the Action End Date and the relevant land shall no longer form part of the land described in the Agreement Document (the “Agreement Land”).

        <p class="govuk-body">3.1 What is Management Control&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">You will have “Management Control” if you have sufficient control over how the Agreement Land is managed to complete the Actions you have selected. This is explained in the section about ‘Check if you have management control of land’ in the Scheme Rules.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">3.2  Management Control for the duration of the Agreement or until the Action End Date&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(a) Where the Agreement Document specifies Actions with the same Action Start Date and the same Action End Date, you must have Management Control of the Agreement Land for the entire Agreement Period.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(b) Where the Agreement Document specifies Actions of varying lengths, you must have Management Control of the Agreement Land required for each Action respectively from the Action Start Date until the Action End Date. The Action will expire after the Action End Date and the relevant land shall no longer form part of the Agreement Land.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">3.3 If you lose Management Control&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(a) you must ensure that by entering the land into the Agreement you do not breach the conditions of your tenancy; and&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(b) if the tenancy expires before the Agreement End Date, or the Action End Date if it is earlier than the Agreement End Date, you must only include this land in your Agreement Land if you expect to have Management Control of this land for the entire Agreement Period if the Agreement Document specifies Actions of the same length or until the Action End Date if the Agreement Document specifies Actions of varying lengths.</p>

        <h2 id="common-land-and-shared-grazing">4. Common Land and Shared Grazing&nbsp;</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">4.1  What is Common Land and Shared Grazing &nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Common land (“Common Land”) is:&nbsp;<br></p>

        <ul>
          <li>land registered as common land in a register of common land kept under Part 1 of the Commons Act 2006;&nbsp;<br>
          </li>
          <li>land to which Part 1 of that Act does not apply and which is subject to rights of common within the meaning of that Act; and&nbsp;<br>
          </li>
          <li>Shared Grazing.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">“Shared Grazing” means communal pasture that is not registered as common land where graziers have a legal entitlement to graze.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">4.2 What Common Land can be included in the Agreement &nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">You cannot include Common Land in the Agreement Land.</p>

        <h2 id="annual-declaration">5. Annual Declaration&nbsp;</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">5.1  What is the Annual Declaration&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Your “Annual Declaration” confirms that you have complied, or expect to have complied, with your obligations under the Agreement for the relevant Agreement Year. This is explained in the section about ‘Managing your SFI agreement’ in the Scheme Rules.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">5.2 When to submit an Annual Declaration&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">You must submit your Annual Declaration to us each “Agreement Year” (each twelve (12) month period following the Agreement Start Date). You must do this by a date that we will specify (the “Due Date”) which will be within the last two (2) months of the relevant Agreement Year.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">5.3 What happens if you do not submit your Annual Declaration&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">If you do not submit your Annual Declaration by the Due Date, it may affect the Grant paid to you as set out in condition 9 (Payments), and we may also treat this as a breach of your obligations under the Agreement under condition 12.&nbsp;</p>

        <h2 id="changes-to-youragreement">6. Changes to your Agreement&nbsp;</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">6.1 Adding Actions or land to the Agreement&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(a) We will not usually allow you to remove an Action from the Agreement or remove land from the Agreement Land. This is explained in the section about ‘Managing your SFI agreement’ in the Scheme Rules.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(b) If you want to remove an Action or remove land forming part of the Agreement Land from the Agreement, you must write to us to request this and explain (providing any supporting evidence) why you wish to do so.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(d) If we approve a request to remove an Action or remove land forming part of the Agreement Land from the Agreement, then we may reduce, recover or withhold payment of the Grant in whole or in part until that request has been processed and the Agreement amended accordingly.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">6.3 Adding land to Rotational Actions in the Agreement</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(a) If your Agreement includes Actions which, after the first Agreement Year, can move location for each subsequent Agreement Year until the relevant Action End Date for the Action (“Rotational Actions”), you can either:</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) complete the relevant Rotational Action on the same Agreement Land &nbsp;until the Action End Date for the relevant Rotational Action in accordance with condition 6.3(b) or condition 6.3(c) as relevant; or</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) move the location of the relevant Rotational Action to other existing Agreement Land, or add land to the Agreement Land and move the relevant Rotational Action to that Agreement Land in accordance with condition 6.3(b)(ii) or condition 6.3(c)(ii) below, as relevant.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(b) If you were eligible to apply for your Agreement because you were an “Exception Group Applicant”, after the first Agreement Year, for each subsequent Agreement Year until the Action End Date for the relevant Rotational Action you can:</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) complete the relevant Rotational Action on the same area of Agreement Land that you entered for the preceding Agreement Year; or</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) increase the area of land you enter into the relevant Rotational Action for the relevant Agreement Year either on existing Agreement Land or by adding land to the Agreement Land with no upper limit on the area of land you can add.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(c) If you were eligible to apply for your Agreement because you were a “Restricted Offer Applicant”, after the first Agreement Year, for each subsequent Agreement Year until the Action End Date for the relevant Rotational Action you can:</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)  complete the relevant Rotational Action on the same area of Agreement Land that you entered for the preceding Agreement Year; or</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) &nbsp;add land to the Agreement Land for your selected Rotational Action for an Agreement Year provided the total area of Agreement Land you enter into your selected Rotational Actions is not more than the total area of Agreement Land you entered into your selected Rotational Actions for the first Agreement Year.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">We will explain the process for varying land entered into Rotational Actions in the Scheme Information.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">6.4 When we may change your Agreement&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(a) We will not usually seek to vary your Agreement during the Agreement Period (in a way not referred to elsewhere in these Terms and Conditions). This is explained in the section about ‘Managing your SFI agreement’ in the Scheme Rules.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(b) However, it is possible we may offer you an Agreement upgrade during the Agreement Period. For example, this may be the case if we make changes to these Terms and Conditions or the Actions.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(c) If we offer you an Agreement upgrade under condition 6.4(b), which we consider to be beneficial to you:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) we will notify you by publishing details on GOV.UK and by writing to you setting out the details of the Agreement upgrade, including when the updated Agreement will apply from; and&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) if you wish to reject the Agreement upgrade and continue with your existing Agreement, you must write to tell us within eight (8) weeks of our notification under condition 6.4(c)(i).&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(d) If we offer you an Agreement upgrade under condition 6.4(b) which is not covered by condition 6.4(c):&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) we will notify you in writing setting out the details of the Agreement upgrade; and&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) it will be possible for you either to accept the Agreement upgrade, or continue with your existing Agreement;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) if you do not accept in the manner set out in our notification under condition 6.4(d)(i), the Agreement upgrade will not be applied to your Agreement.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(e) There may also be exceptional circumstances (not referred to elsewhere in these Terms and Conditions) where we have to vary your Agreement during the Agreement Period. We will only do this due to exceptional circumstances, such as:&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) changes in Law which must be reflected in the Agreement; and/or&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the need to respond to wider government emergency measures and/or measures imperative to the national interest, for example, disease outbreaks or food security emergencies.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(f) If we vary the Agreement under condition 6.4(e):&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) we will notify you in writing and will endeavour to give such notice as is reasonable and proportionate, having regard to the nature of the variation,&nbsp; its consequences for you and any action required from you;&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) any variation to the Agreement will apply from the date we specify in our notice to you, provided you take the action required as set out in the notice; and&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) if the variation to the Agreement under condition 6.4(e) is unacceptable to you, you can terminate your Agreement by notifying us in writing within a reasonable period that we will specify in our notice to you.  If you do not accept the variation in the manner set out in our notification, we may terminate your Agreement in accordance with condition 15.1(b). Condition 15.3(d) will not apply, provided you inform us within the period specified by us.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">6.5 When we may temporarily adjust your Agreement&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(a) We may identify factors which may temporarily impact your ability to complete your selected Actions, meaning you are temporarily unable to comply with your obligations under the Agreement. These factors may include, but are not limited to, adverse weather conditions such as flooding or drought. This is explained in the section about ‘Managing your SFI agreement’ in the Scheme Rules.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(b) If condition 6.5(a) applies, we may make a temporary adjustment to the Actions in the Agreement, with this temporary adjustment only being effective during a time period specified by us.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(c) If we make a temporary adjustment under condition 6.5(b) we will notify you by publishing details on GOV.UK and will endeavour to give such notice as is reasonable and proportionate. Our notice on GOV.UK will set out:&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the time period for when the temporary adjustment applies, including a start date and end date;&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the evidence you must keep if you choose to comply with the temporary adjustment, as described under condition 6.5(f).&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(d) The temporary adjustment under condition 6.5(b) will cease to apply after the end date specified in our notice under condition 6.5(c). After that end date, you must complete your selected Actions to comply with your obligations under the Agreement as if no temporary adjustment had been made.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(e) There is no obligation for you to comply with the temporary adjustment under condition 6.5(b). You can continue to complete your selected Actions without complying with the temporary adjustment under Condition 6.5(b).&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">(f) If you choose to comply with the temporary adjustment under Condition 6.5(b), you must:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
