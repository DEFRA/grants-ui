      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">1. About the Farm payments technical test</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The Farm payments technical test (FPTT) is open to a small number of invited farmers
        to test a new farm payments platform. It allows farmers to apply for up to 4 land
        management practices on their land, known as ‘actions’.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">This FPTT information includes the rules which apply to FPTT agreements.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Your FPTT agreement will last for 12 months unless your agreement ends early.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">1.1 FPTT actions</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">The actions include:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>CMOR1: Assess moorland and produce a written record</li>
        <li>UPL1: Moderate livestock grazing on moorland</li>
        <li>UPL2: Low livestock grazing on moorland</li>
        <li>UPL3: Limited livestock grazing on moorland</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You can select any combination of these actions if your land is eligible for them. Each
        action sets out which other actions you can do on the same area of land.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You can apply for these actions without specialist advice or approval.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        These actions are static. This means you must do them at the same location for the 12
        month duration of your FPTT agreement.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You’ll find the details of these actions in the

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">2. When and how much you’ll get paid</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Your agreement document will set out the details of your payments. This includes:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the annual payment value for your selected actions</li>
        <li>the payments you’ll receive for each quarter of your agreement</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Under an FPTT agreement, your annual payment value is paid in quarterly instalments.
        You’ll usually receive your first payment in the fourth month after your agreement’s start
        date.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        You do not have to submit an annual claim to get paid. You’ll receive the first 3
        instalments by automated BACS transfer.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You must submit an annual declaration (a simple tick box form) before you’re paid the
        fourth instalment. Read section 12.1 ‘Submit your annual declaration’ to find out what
        you must submit to get paid your fourth instalment.
      </p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">2.1 About your payment</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The RPA will usually email your payment details to you a few days before you get paid
        to tell you:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>how much you’ll be paid</li>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">2.2 How your payment is calculated</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">Your FPTT agreement’s total annual payment value is based on:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the area of land (in hectares) you’ve entered into your selected actions</li>
        <li>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">4. Check if you have management control of land</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You must have management control of the land parcels you enter into your FPTT
        agreement for the duration of your agreement.
      </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">4.1 Who has management control</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You’ll have management control if you have sufficient control over how the land is
        managed to complete the actions you’ve selected. For the FPTT, this means you’re the
        person actively farming or managing the land. Usually, this means you’re:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>an owner-occupier who’s either farming or managing the land themselves or employing a contractor</li>
        <li>
          a tenant with a Farm Business Tenancy (FBT) under the Agricultural Tenancies
          Act 1995, or an Agricultural Holdings Act 1986 tenancy – read section 4.2 ‘Land
          you occupy under a tenancy agreement’
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">You will not have <man></man>agement control if you’re:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>a landlord, as you’re not actively farming or managing the land</li>
        <li>
          a licensee, who only has access to the land under a licence arrangement – if you
          have wider land management responsibilities similar to a tenancy (such as
          Ministry of Defence licences), read section 4.2 about ‘land you occupy under a
          tenancy agreement’
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        When you enter land into an FPTT agreement, you declare that you’ll have
        management control of it for the duration of your agreement. You must provide evidence
        of this if the RPA asks for it.
      </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">4.2 Land you occupy under a tenancy agreement</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If you occupy land under an FBT or an Agricultural Holdings Act 1986 tenancy, you must
        make sure that by entering this land into an FPTT agreement, you do not breach the
        conditions of your tenancy.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Your tenancy may be due to expire before the end date of your FPTT agreement. This
        will usually be the case if, for example, you occupy land under an FBT granted for a
        term of:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>than 2 years, that you expect to continue on a rolling year-by-year basis</li>
        <li>2 years or less, that you expect your landlord to renew when the term expires</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        In this case, you must only enter this land into an FPTT agreement if you expect to have
        management control over it for the duration of your agreement.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If you’re not sure if your tenancy will continue (or be renewed), you need to check this
        with your landlord before you enter the land into an FPTT agreement.
      </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">4.3 Unexpected loss of management control</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You must tell the RPA in writing if you unexpectedly lose management control of your
        agreement land before your FPTT agreement ends.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You must do this in writing as soon as possible. Preferably this should be within 8 weeks
        of you being able to do so.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">If you lose management control of:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>all your agreement land, the RPA will end the agreement</li>
        <li>some of your agreement land, the RPA will remove the affected land from your agreement</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        In both cases, you may have to repay some or all the payments you’ve already
        received. Read section 13.2: ‘What you must do if you cannot comply with your agreement’.

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Land type describes the type of land in more detail. For example, different types of
        grassland, such as improved grassland and low input (semi-improved or unimproved
        grassland).
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The land type must be eligible for your selected actions at the start of your FPTT agreement.</p>

        land type is eligible for each action you select.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The following are the definitions of how certain land types are defined for FPTT.
      </p>
      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Permanent grassland</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Permanent grassland is land used to grow grass for 5 consecutive years or more that’s
        not been included in an arable crop rotation. It can either be improved or low input.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Improved permanent grassland is permanent grassland that’s been agriculturally
        ‘improved’ by at least one of the following activities:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>regularly reseeding, or reseeding within the last 15 years</li>
        <li>
          regularly applying fertiliser (typically at least 100 kilograms per hectare per year
          of nitrogen as an artificial compound fertiliser or animal manures and slurries)
        </li>
        <li>blanket herbicide application to treat weeds</li>
        <li>maintaining field drains</li>
        <li>taking conserved forage as silage, haylage or hay more than once a year</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Improved grassland will usually have a high cover of ryegrasses and white clover, with a
        low cover of wildflowers and sedges.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Low input (semi-improved or unimproved) permanent grassland is permanent grassland
        that’s been managed by doing at least one of the following activities:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>no reseeding for at least 15 years</li>
        <li>applying low or no amounts of artificial compound fertiliser or animal manures and slurries</li>
        <li>applying localised or no herbicide to treat weeds</li>
        <li>
          leaving field drains unmaintained or maintaining them infrequently (hay meadows may be more actively drained)
        </li>
        <li>
          taking conserved forage as hay or haylage no more than once a year
        </li>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          been managed so it’s had some agricultural ‘improvement’ – for example, by
          applying low amounts of fertiliser or localised herbicide to treat weeds
        </li>
        <li>
          a moderate cover (more than around 30%) of ryegrasses and white clover, with a
          high cover of wildflowers and sedges
        </li>
      </ul>

        Unimproved low input grassland will have had no agricultural ‘improvement’, usually for
        at least 15 years. For example, no application of fertiliser or herbicide. This includes the
        land type ‘rough grazing’ as set out in the relevant actions (see also moorland).
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Species-rich permanent grassland is permanent grassland that has:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          minimal cover of white clover and perennial ryegrass – this will usually be less than around 10% of the area
        </li>
        <li>
          species-rich sward – this usually means there are more than 15 plant species per square metre, including grasses
        </li>
        <li>
          a high cover of wildflowers and sedges, excluding white clover, creeping
          buttercup, and injurious weeds – this will usually be more than around 30% of the area

      </ul>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Moorland</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Moorland includes permanent grassland and certain non-agricultural features, such as
        scrub, scree, bracken and bog, which are above the moorland line. You can find out
        which land is above the moorland line on the

      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The vegetation of moorland areas is usually:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>semi-natural moorland habitats including heathland, blanket bog, rough acid
        grasslands, rushy flushes, swamps, mires and bracken</li>
        <li>upland calcareous grassland</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">Much upland moorland is either registered common land or shared grazing.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">5.2 Eligible land covers</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Land cover is registered by the RPA on your digital maps. It describes the physical
        nature of the land. There are 3 agricultural land covers:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>arable land</li>
        <li>permanent grassland – this is the only land cover that applies to FPTT actions</li>
        <li>permanent crops</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        There are also non-agricultural land covers, such as woodland and farm buildings.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        For each land parcel you want to enter into an FPTT action, you need to check that its
        area is registered on your digital maps with a land cover that’s eligible for the action –
        read the guidance on
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/digital-maps-in-the-rural-payments-service-check-and-change-mapping-updates"

      <p class="govuk-body">The eligible land covers are set out in each action.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">5.3 Available area calculation</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        When you select FPTT actions the application service will calculate what area in each
        land parcel may be eligible for the action. This is called the ‘available area’.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The available area is calculated for each action you select by taking the land parcel’s
        total area and subtracting (where relevant) any area which has been:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>registered with a land cover that is not eligible for the action</li>
        <li>
          entered into another FPTT action, SFI action, CS option, static ES option, that is
          not compatible with the action or means there would be double funding
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The application service cannot subtract any area entered into a rotational ES option that
        is not compatible or means there would be double funding. You will need to enter this
        area and the RPA will manually subtract it when they process your application. They will
        contact you before they do this.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        It’s your responsibility to check that the available area you want to enter into
        an FPTT action in each land parcel:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>is an eligible land type for the action – read section 5.1 ‘Eligible land types for FPTT’</li>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">5.4 Land that’s a site of special scientific interest (SSSI)</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You can enter land that’s an SSSI into actions if it’s eligible. Each action sets this out.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If you apply for actions on land that’s an SSSI, you must get SSSI consent from Natural
        England. You must do this before you do UPL1, UPL2 or UPL3 on this land. CMOR1 is
        exempt.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Read section 10.3: ‘SSSI consent’ to find out how to get SSSI consent and which
        actions are exempt.

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="section-5.5">5.5 Land with historic or archaeological features</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You can enter land with historic or archaeological features into actions if it’s eligible.
        Each action sets this out.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Historic or archaeological features include:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>non-designated historic or archaeological features (also known as ‘SHINE’ features)</li>

        <li>scheduled monuments</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If land with historic or archaeological features is ineligible for an action, this only affects
        the area where the feature is located in a land parcel. You can apply for the action on
        the remaining area in the land parcel if it’s eligible.
      </p>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Request an SFI Historic Environment Farm Environment Record (SFI HEFER)</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If you apply for FPTT actions on land with historic or archaeological features, you must
        <a href="https://hefer-data.org.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
          request an SFI HEFER (opens in new tab)</a> from Historic England. You must have this in place
        before the RPA can offer you an FPTT agreement.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        For the purposes of the FPTT, you need to have an SFI HEFER. The information in it is
        still relevant to FPTT agreements, even though you are not applying for SFI.
      </p>
      <p class=govuk-body>
        You will need to register to use the HEFER portal if you have not requested a HEFER before.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You cannot use an existing HEFER you may already have for an SFI or CS agreement.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        You will receive an email when your SFI HEFER is available to download. This should
        be within 2 days from when you request it.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If your SFI HEFER identifies a scheduled monument, you may need to get consent from
        Historic England before you do your selected FPTT actions on that land. Read section
        10.1 ‘Scheduled monument consent’ to find out when you must get scheduled
        monument consent and how to get it.

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Soil sampling on eligible land with historic or archaeological features</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If an FPTT action requires you to take soil samples, where possible, avoid doing this on
        any area of land with an historic or archaeological feature identified on your SFI HEFER.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If you need to take soil samples on an area of land with a SHINE feature, or that’s a

      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If you want to remove an action or land from your agreement, or end it early, you must

        You will not usually be able to transfer your agreement to another person if, for example,

        <li>you sell it to someone else</li>
        <li>your tenancy on the land ends, and there’s a new tenant</li>

        Instead, you must email or write to the RPA about this as soon as possible. As you’ll no
        longer have management control of the land you’ve transferred, the RPA will need to
        remove it from your agreement.

        The RPA will not usually change your FPTT agreement during the agreement period.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        There may be exceptional circumstances which mean the RPA has to change your
        agreement. For example, changes in the law, disease outbreaks or food security
        emergencies. In this case:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>they will notify you in writing, giving as much notice as possible</li>
        <li>the change will apply from the date specified by the RPA in their notice</li>

          if the change is not acceptable to you, you can end your agreement by telling
          the RPA in writing by the deadline they’ll specify in their notice – you will not be
          required to repay payments you’ve already received

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">12.6 Temporary adjustments to the actions in your agreement</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The RPA may identify factors which may temporarily affect your ability to complete
        the FPTT actions in your agreement. This could include, for example, adverse weather
        conditions, such as flooding or drought.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If this happens, the RPA may make a temporary adjustment to the FPTT actions for a
        period of time specified by them. To do this they will email you as the agreement holder
        giving you as much notice as possible. This email will include:
      </p>

        <li>hat the temporary adjustment is – including which FPTT actions it affects</li>
        <li>the start and end dates for the temporary adjustment</li>
        <li>the evidence you must keep if you choose to comply with the temporary adjustment</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        After the temporary adjustment’s end date, you must complete your selected FPTT
        actions as if the temporary adjustment no longer applies.

          you’ve completed what’s required in each of your selected FPTT actions in a way
          that could reasonably be expected to achieve their aims
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">13.1 How the RPA will check you’re complying with your agreement</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The RPA will check you’re complying with your agreement’s obligations through a
        combination of:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>physical or virtual site visits</li>
        <li>remote monitoring</li>
        <li>desk-based administrative checks</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">The RPA may ask you to supply supporting evidence to show, for example, that:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>you have management control of your land</li>
        <li>
          you’ve completed what’s required in each FPTT action you’ve selected in a way
          that could reasonably be expected to achieve its aim – each action sets out what
          evidence you must keep
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">Your agreement’s terms and conditions explain that you must:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>provide this evidence if the RPA requests it</li>
        <li>
          keep this evidence for at least 7 years from your agreement’s end date, or its
          termination date if that’s earlier
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Site visits</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">If the RPA selects your farm or land for a site visit, they’ll:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>try to arrange a suitable date and time with you in advance</li>
        <li>let you know what to expect during the visit</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If it’s not possible to arrange a suitable date and time, the RPA will write to you by email
        or post explaining the purpose, date and time of the visit. This will be at least 48 hours
        before the site visit, unless the RPA has reason to suspect there’s been a serious
        breach of your agreement, fraud or any other related offence.
      </p>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Remote monitoring</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The RPA uses aerial photography and satellite imagery to carry out remote monitoring
        of land cover, vegetation condition and soil erosion risk. This aims to:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>reduce the need for physical site visits</li>
        <li>
          make sure the FPTT actions are being done in a way that could reasonably be
          expected to achieve their aims
        </li>
        <li>identify potential issues so the RPA can give targeted support</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Desk-based administrative checks</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The RPA carries out desk-based administrative checks to make sure you’re meeting
        your FPTT agreement’s obligations. This can include checking the nature and quality of
        any supporting evidence they ask you to supply, such as receipts and farm records.
      </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="section-13.2">13.2 What you must do if you cannot comply with your agreement</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You must tell the RPA in writing as soon as possible if something happens within or
        outside your control which might reasonably be expected to affect your ability to comply
        with your FPTT agreement’s obligations. This is called a ‘change of circumstances’.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">A change of circumstances includes something that may affect:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>your eligibility to get paid</li>
        <li>how much you’re paid</li>
        <li>your ability to complete your selected FPTT actions</li>
        <li>your ability to comply with your agreement’s terms and conditions</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Preferably, you should tell the RPA about a change of circumstances within 8 weeks of
        you being able to do so.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You can notify the RPA about a change of circumstances by email or post. When you
        email or write to the RPA, you should include:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>your SBI</li>
        <li>your FPTT agreement reference number, which you can find on your agreement document</li>
        <li>
          as many details as possible about the change of circumstances, including
          specific details about any FPTT actions you cannot complete
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The RPA will look at each change of circumstances on a case-by-case basis. Depending on what’s happened, they may:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
       <li>amend your agreement, for example, by removing land or FPTT actions</li>
        <li>reduce your payments</li>
        <li>ask you to repay some or all of the payments you’ve already received</li>
        <li>end your agreement early (before your agreement’s end date)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The RPA will tell you what their decision is. If you do not agree with it, you can use
        the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/rural-payments-agency/about/complaints-procedure"
               class="govuk-link" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">complaints procedure (opens in new tab)</a> complaints procedure to ask
        the RPA to reconsider it. You must do this within 60 calendar days of the date you’re notified of the decision.
      </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">13.3 How you could breach your agreement</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">You could breach your FPTT agreement if you have:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>not notified the RPA of a change of circumstances</li>
        <li>given false or misleading information</li>
        <li>used the payments received under your agreement for a purpose that’s not in accordance with the agreement</li>
        <li>
          used the payments received under your agreement for activities that breach any law you’re required to comply with
        </li>
        <li>failed to comply with the terms of your agreement</li>
        <li>breached a requirement you’re subject to under the Agriculture (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2021, as amended</li>
        <li>failed to provide required information, records or evidence</li>
        <li>
          prevented an authorised person from carrying out a virtual or physical site visit of the land in your agreement
        </li>
        <li>
          refused a reasonable request by an authorised person to provide assistance to carry out a virtual or
          physical site visit of the land in your agreement
        </li>
        <li>obstructed a virtual or physical site visit of the land in your agreement</li>
        <li>
          failed to prevent or report actual or anticipated fraud or corruption in relation to the payments you receive
          under your agreement
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        This includes a breach caused by your employees or someone acting on your behalf,
        unless it relates to a change of circumstances or actual or anticipated fraud or
        corruption.
      </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">13.4 If the RPA suspects there’s been a breach</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        When the RPA checks if you’re complying with your FPTT agreement, they may
        reasonably suspect there’s been a breach.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If this is the case, the RPA will:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          carry out a proportionate investigation to determine whether there has been a
          breach – unlike previous schemes, they will not usually withhold your payments while investigating
        </li>
        <li>discuss their investigation with you, where possible, so you understand what they have found</li>
        <li>
          consider any ‘good reasons’ for the suspected breach (read section 13.6
          Good reasons for a breach’ for more information)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The RPA may also ask you to provide more information or evidence.
        Once the RPA has completed their investigation, they’ll write to tell you:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the outcome</li>
        <li>
          how you can respond to the outcome if you do not agree with it – including the
          deadline for submitting your response in writing
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The RPA will consider your response before making a formal decision (known as a
        ‘determination’) about whether you have breached your agreement.
      </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">13.5 RPA confirms there’s been a breach</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">If the RPA decides that you have breached your FPTT agreement, they will:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>explain the reasons for their determination in writing</li>
        <li>
          decide what action, if any, they will take – there are no set actions that they’ll take
          for particular breaches of your agreement
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        What the RPA does about the breach will depend on the individual circumstances of
        your case. They will consider factors such as:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>how serious the breach was</li>
        <li>if you had a ‘good reason’ for the breach – read section 13.6: ‘Good reasons for a breach’</li>
        <li>why the breach happened and any consequences it may have</li>
        <li>
          what impact the breach has on achieving the aims of the FPTT actions in your
          agreement, and whether that impact will be short or longer term
        </li>
        <li>if you can take action to make sure you are complying with your agreement</li>
        <li>any past conduct and whether a similar breach has happened before</li>
        <li>if you intentionally breached your agreement</li>
        <li>whether the breach constitutes an offence and has caused widespread or irreparable damage</li>
        <li>if you have not co-operated with the RPA checking you’re complying with your agreement</li>
        <li>if you notified the RPA about a change of circumstances (if applicable)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">The RPA may decide that no action is needed because:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>of the nature of the breach</li>
        <li>you’ve supplied evidence to them of a ‘good reason’ for the breach</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">If the RPA decides action is needed, they may:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

        <li>
          temporarily or permanently amend, remove or replace a condition subject to
          which your agreement’s payments are made to you
        </li>
        <li>temporarily or permanently amend, remove or replace your selected FPTT actions or timescales</li>
        <li>allow you to rectify the breach</li>
        <li>
          delay, reduce, recover or withhold payments or require you to repay some or all
          the payments you’ve already received
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">The RPA may decide that there’s a serious breach of your FPTT agreement because it:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>was intentional</li>
        <li>was due to negligence or recklessness</li>
        <li>has happened more than once, without good reason</li>

        <li>end your FPTT agreement before its end date</li>
        <li>prevent you from receiving payments under any other financial assistance scheme for up to 2 years</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Where there is evidence of fraud or illegality, they will follow the relevant legal process.
      </p>

        If you do not agree with the RPA’s determination that there’s been a breach, you can
        use the

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">13.6 Good reasons for a breach</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        There may be circumstances (a ‘good reason’) which mean you breach your FPTT
        agreement’s obligations because of events outside of your control.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Good reasons for a breach include, but are not limited to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>natural events, such as prolonged adverse weather conditions, flooding, or animal or plant disease</li>
        <li>if you are seriously ill</li>
        <li>the death of the agreement holder</li>
        <li>
          if there is unforeseen loss of management control of the land in your agreement,
          for example when a tenancy is terminated, or because of the compulsory purchase of land by a third party
        </li>
        <li>financial circumstances, such as bankruptcy</li>
        <li>evidenced supply chain problems, such as a lack of laboratory soil testing capacity</li>
        <li>criminal damage by a third party, such as arson or vandalism</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If there’s a ‘good reason’ for the breach of your agreement, you (or someone authorised
        to act on your behalf) must write to the RPA to explain:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          what has happened, including details of the events outside your control which meant you breached your agreement
        </li>
        <li>whether you can take action to make sure you are complying with your agreement</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You must email or write to the RPA immediately if the good reason is because you’ve breached your agreement by:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>preventing the RPA from carrying out a site visit</li>
        <li>refusing to provide assistance with a site visit</li>
        <li>otherwise obstructing a virtual or physical site visit of the land in your agreement</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        In all other cases, you must email or write to the RPA within 8 weeks from the date that either:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>you are able to</li>
        <li>the RPA notifies you of their determination that you’ve breached your agreement</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">The RPA will:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>consider your individual circumstances – they may ask you to supply further evidence</li>
        <li>decide what action, if any, they will take – they will tell you about their decision</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If you knew about the issue when you entered your agreement, it’s unlikely the RPA will
        consider it to be a good reason for a breach.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The RPA will also take ‘good reasons’ into account when they investigate a suspected
        breach of your agreement. Read section 13.4: ‘If the RPA suspect there’s been a breach’.
