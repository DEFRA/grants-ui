        The following advice may help you to do this action, but it’s not part of this action’s requirements.
      </p>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">How to record your moorland survey</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You can record your survey digitally or on paper. You may also want to take
        photographs of the vegetation you assess and the surrounding area.
      </p>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">When to do the survey</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The best time to survey moorland is between mid-July and the end of October. This
        avoids the main bird breeding season (March to mid-July).
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/wild-birds-protection-surveys-and-licences#what-you-must-not-do"
           class="govuk-link" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
          Birds, nests and eggs are protected by law (opens in new tab)
        </a>, so if you see signs of nesting birds, delay the survey until the birds fledge.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Try to avoid doing the survey after periods of heavy or prolonged rainfall.</p>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">How to divide your moorland into blocks</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        To divide your moorland into blocks of around 10 hectares, you may find it helpful to use:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          a paper or digital Ordnance Survey (OS) map that’s a scale of 1:10,000 or
          1:25,000 and shows contours – you can overlay the OS map with a grid to
          divide the moorland into rectangular blocks
        </li>
        <li>
          the
          <a href="https://magic.defra.gov.uk/home.htm"
            class="govuk-link" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
            MAGIC website (opens in new tab)
          </a> – you can zoom in to a scale of 1:25000 or 1:10000 to see
          10 hectare squares covering all land within the moorland line
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">How to select sample points within the blocks</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">Before you do your survey, it will help if you:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>divide each 10 hectare block into 3 smaller areas</li>
        <li>
          select a sample point within each of the 3 smaller areas that broadly
          represents the main soil types and vegetation within the 10 hectare block – so
          there are 3 sample points in each 10 hectare block
        </li>
        <li>
          give each sample point a number on the OS map, so you can identify where
          your observations were taken
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">Choose sample points that you can safely access to complete the survey.</p>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Carrying out your survey</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        At each sample point, you can record its number on the OS map and take a short walk
        around the area to identify, assess and record what’s required by this action.
      </p>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">How to identify soil types and assess depth of peat</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">Soil types include non-peat, shallow peat and deep peat.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        To assess the soil type, and depth of any peat, you can use a thin rod or cane to probe
        the soil. You may find it helpful to mark the rod or cane with measurements from its
        base. For example, 5 centimetres (cm), 10cm, 25cm, 30cm and 40cm.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You can push the rod or cane into the soil until you feel resistance or to a depth of more
        than 40cm. If it meets resistance at a depth of:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>less than 5cm, record the soil type as non-peat</li>
        <li>between 5cm and 40cm, record the soil type as shallow peat</li>
        <li>more than 40cm, record the soil type as deep peat</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If there is existing data available on the presence of peat and its depth, you can use this
        instead of probing the soil.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Try to avoid probing the soil on areas with historic or archaeological features, as identified on your SFI HEFER.
      </p>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">How to assess the wetness of peat</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The wetness of peat soils can affect the environmental benefits (such as carbon storage) which your moorland provides.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">If you’ve identified the soil type as shallow or deep peat, you can assess its wetness by:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>visually looking at the area</li>
        <li>probing the soil with the same thin rod or cane you used to assess the depth of peat</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">You can record it as:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          dry or firm peat, if no peat sticks to your thin rod or cane – you can also record
          it as an opportunity to restore environmental benefits (carbon storage)
        </li>
        <li>
          moist peat, if the area looks damp on the surface and your thin rod or cane is
          moist when you remove it from the peat – you can also record it as an
          opportunity to enhance the environmental benefits (carbon storage)
        </li>
        <li>
          wet peat, if there’s standing water, or water appears when you press the peat
          with your foot – you can also record it as already providing environmental
          benefits (carbon storage) which you can maintain
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">How to assess the roughness of the ground surface</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The roughness of the ground surface can affect the environmental benefits (such as
        storage and water flow) which your moorland provides.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">A rough ground surface helps to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>allow more water to evaporate or infiltrate the soil</li>
        <li>slow the flow of water by holding it back from watercourses</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        To assess the roughness of the ground surface, you can walk around the sample point

          Livestock grazing on moorland calculator</a> to calculate the livestock density per ha.
      </p>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Grazing on moorland</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">Cattle, sheep, and ponies graze in different ways.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You can achieve greater environmental benefits if you graze the moorland with:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>a livestock species which has suitable grazing traits for the habitat type</li>
        <li>a suitable number of livestock for the habitat type, to avoid overgrazing or under grazing it</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Grazing traits: ponies</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">Ponies:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>can graze swards very tight, and at low stocking densities can create a good structural mosaic</li>
        <li>
          have a strong preference for grasses and will graze long coarse grass, such
          as purple moor-grass
        </li>
        <li>are very adaptable grazers, and can graze bracken (particularly in the autumn) and gorse</li>
        <li>are less likely to graze heather over the winter months compared with sheep</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Grazing traits: cattle</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">Cattle:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          graze on longer swards, and graze less selectively than sheep and on coarser
          forage, creating a more varied sward structure
        </li>
        <li>
          will graze lower quality forage such as purple moor-grass, particularly in the spring and early summer
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Cattle are more likely to cause poaching due to their size, particularly on wetter areas.
        You can remove them from the area over the winter months to reduce the risk of poaching.
      </p>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Grazing traits: sheep</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">Sheep:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>can graze swards very tight</li>
        <li>are highly selective feeders at fine scale, often selecting young flowers and shoots</li>
        <li>are unlikely to eat long coarse grasses, such as purple moor-grass, if alternative food is available</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Sheep can cause a decline in dwarf shrub cover due to selective browsing, particularly
        when out over the winter months. You can reduce the risk of this happening by:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>removing all the sheep for the entire winter or part of the winter (‘partial off-wintering’)</li>
        <li>reducing sheep numbers during the winter months</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Grazing to maintain or enhance moorland habitat</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        To help you achieve this action’s aim, you can maintain or enhance the habitat on your
        moorland by grazing appropriately. This includes trying to avoid grazing on sensitive
        priority habitats, which may damage the habitat.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You’ll usually need to graze the following moorland habitats, as relevant:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>most grasslands</li>
        <li>fens and flushes</li>
        <li>most heathlands</li>
        <li>land with historic and archaeological features, to avoid causing damage from trees, bracken and scrub</li>
        <li>upland wood pasture</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">Sensitive priority habitats which may be damaged by grazing include:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>most woodlands</li>
        <li>blanket bog</li>
        <li>mountain heath</li>
        <li>willow scrub</li>
        <li>fragmented upland heath that needs to be restored</li>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Neighbouring livestock</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If the area of moorland you enter into this action is unfenced and adjacent land is
        grazed by other farmers or land managers, you may need to:

        <li>
          consider the potential impact of neighbouring livestock straying on your ability

          Livestock grazing on moorland calculator</a> to calculate the livestock density per ha.
      </p>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Grazing on moorland</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">Cattle, sheep, and ponies graze in different ways.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You can achieve greater environmental benefits if you graze the moorland with:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>a livestock species which has suitable grazing traits for the habitat type</li>
        <li>a suitable number of livestock for the habitat type, to avoid overgrazing or under grazing it</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Grazing traits: ponies</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">Ponies:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>can graze swards very tight, and at low stocking densities can create a good structural mosaic</li>
        <li>
          have a strong preference for grasses and will graze long coarse grass, such
          as purple moor-grass
        </li>
        <li>are very adaptable grazers, and can graze bracken (particularly in the autumn) and gorse</li>
        <li>are less likely to graze heather over the winter months compared with sheep</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Grazing traits: cattle</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">Cattle:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          graze on longer swards, and graze less selectively than sheep and on coarser
          forage, creating a more varied sward structure
        </li>
        <li>
          will graze lower quality forage such as purple moor-grass, particularly in the spring and early summer
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Cattle are more likely to cause poaching due to their size, particularly on wetter areas.
        You can remove them from the area over the winter months to reduce the risk of poaching.
      </p>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Grazing traits: sheep</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">Sheep:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>can graze swards very tight</li>
        <li>are highly selective feeders at fine scale, often selecting young flowers and shoots</li>
        <li>are unlikely to eat long coarse grasses, such as purple moor-grass, if alternative food is available</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Sheep can cause a decline in dwarf shrub cover due to selective browsing, particularly
        when out over the winter months. You can reduce the risk of this happening by:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>removing all the sheep for the entire winter or part of the winter (‘partial off-wintering’)</li>
        <li>reducing sheep numbers during the winter months</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Grazing to maintain or enhance moorland habitat</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        To help you achieve this action’s aim, you can maintain or enhance the habitat on your
        moorland by grazing appropriately. This includes trying to avoid grazing on sensitive
        priority habitats.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You’ll usually need to graze the following moorland habitats, as relevant:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>most grasslands</li>
        <li>fens and flushes</li>
        <li>most heathlands</li>
        <li>land with historic and archaeological features, to avoid trees, bracken and scrub causing damage</li>
        <li>upland wood pasture</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">Sensitive priority habitats which may be damaged by grazing include:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>most woodlands</li>
        <li>blanket bog</li>
        <li>mountain heath</li>
        <li>willow scrub</li>
        <li>fragmented upland heath that needs to be restored</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Neighbouring livestock</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If the area of moorland you enter into this action is unfenced and adjacent land is
        grazed by other farmers or land managers, you may need to:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          consider the potential impact of neighbouring livestock straying on your ability

          threshold
        </li>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">How to calculate the livestock density</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Once you’ve converted your livestock numbers into GLU using the values shown under
        ‘What to do’, you can use the
        <a class="govuk-link"
           href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66a907cffc8e12ac3edb0773/uplands-grazing-calculator.xlsx"
           rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
          Livestock grazing on moorland calculator</a> to calculate the livestock density per ha.
      </p>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Grazing on moorland</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">Cattle, sheep, and ponies graze in different ways.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You can achieve greater environmental benefits if you graze the moorland with:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>a livestock species which has suitable grazing traits for the habitat type</li>
        <li>a suitable number of livestock for the habitat type, to avoid overgrazing or under grazing it</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Grazing traits: ponies</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">Ponies:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>can graze swards very tight, and at low stocking densities can create a good structural mosaic</li>
        <li>
          have a strong preference for grasses and will graze long coarse grass, such
          as purple moor-grass
        </li>
        <li>are very adaptable grazers, and can graze bracken (particularly in the autumn) and gorse</li>
        <li>are less likely to graze heather over the winter months compared with sheep</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Grazing traits: cattle</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">Cattle:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          graze on longer swards, and graze less selectively than sheep and on coarser
          forage, creating a more varied sward structure
        </li>
        <li>
          will graze lower quality forage such as purple moor-grass, particularly in the spring and early summer
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Cattle are more likely to cause poaching due to their size, particularly on wetter areas.
        You can remove them from the area over the winter months to reduce the risk of poaching.
      </p>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Grazing traits: sheep</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">Sheep:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>can graze swards very tight</li>
        <li>are highly selective feeders at fine scale, often selecting young flowers and shoots</li>
        <li>are unlikely to eat long coarse grasses, such as purple moor-grass, if alternative food is available</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Sheep can cause a decline in dwarf shrub cover due to selective browsing, particularly
        when out over the winter months. You can reduce the risk of this happening by:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>removing all the sheep for the entire winter or part of the winter (‘partial off-wintering’)</li>
        <li>reducing sheep numbers during the winter months</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Grazing to maintain or enhance moorland habitat</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        To help you achieve this action’s aim, you can maintain or enhance the habitat on your
        moorland by grazing appropriately. This includes trying to avoid grazing on sensitive
        priority habitats, which may damage the habitat.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You’ll usually need to graze the following moorland habitats, as relevant:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>most grasslands</li>
        <li>fens and flushes</li>
        <li>most heathlands</li>
        <li>land with historic and archaeological features, to avoid trees, bracken and scrub causing damage</li>
        <li>upland wood pasture</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">Sensitive priority habitats which may be damaged by grazing include:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>most woodlands</li>
        <li>blanket bog</li>
        <li>mountain heath</li>
        <li>willow scrub</li>
        <li>fragmented upland heath that needs to be restored</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Neighbouring livestock</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If the area of moorland you enter into this action is unfenced and adjacent land is
        grazed by other farmers or land managers, you may need to:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          consider the potential impact of neighbouring livestock straying on your ability
          to meet this action’s requirements, particularly the maximum livestock density
          threshold
        </li>
        <li>
          talk to neighbouring farmers or land managers about removing stray livestock
          from your area of moorland
        </li>
